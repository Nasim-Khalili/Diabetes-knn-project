# KNN for Diabetes Prediction

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict diabetes based on a given dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used is assumed to be `diabetes.csv`, containing medical features with an `Outcome` column indicating diabetes presence.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Installation
Install the required libraries using:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

Future Improvements
Optimize k value using cross-validation.
Experiment with different distance metrics.
Use feature selection techniques to improve accuracy.
